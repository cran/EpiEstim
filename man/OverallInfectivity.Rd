\title{Overall Infectivity Due To Previously Infected Individuals}
\description{
  \code{OverallInfectivity} computes the overall infectivity due to previously infected individuals. 
}
\usage{
OverallInfectivity(I, SI.Distr)
}
\arguments{
  \item{I}{vector of non-negative integers containing an incidence time series.}
  \item{SI.Distr}{vector of probabilities giving the discrete distribution of the serial interval.}
}
\value{
  \code{OverallInfectivity(I, SI.Distr)} returns a vector which contains the overall infectivity \eqn{\lambda_t} at each time step \eqn{t}.

\details{
  The overall infectivity \eqn{\lambda_t} at time step \eqn{t} is equal to the sum of the previously infected individuals (given by the incidence vector \eqn{I}), 
  weigthed by their infectivity at time \eqn{t} (given by the discrete serial interval distribution \eqn{w_k}). 
  
  In mathematical terms:   
  \cr
  \eqn{\lambda_t = \sum_{k=1}^{t-1}I_{t-k}w_k}
